# Model-View-Controller-MVC-Challenge-Tech-Blog

A short description about your project.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive web application that demonstrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. This project employs the `express-handlebars` package for dynamic views, `MySQL2` and `Sequelize` for database connectivity, and `express-session` for authentication.

A special emphasis is placed on user authentication, post creation, and commenting functionality, ensuring a secure and interactive platform for users to engage with content.

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out, with passwords securely hashed using the `bcrypt` package.
- **Post Creation**: Registered users can create, update, and delete their posts.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on posts, fostering a sense of community and engagement.

This project is a demonstration of robust backend development, integrating various technologies and methodologies to achieve a seamless user experience.
